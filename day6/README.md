# Python

I learned python because I needed a language to do quick analysis in and make plots. I had used Matlab before for those things, but that was not longer an option Matlab is quite expensive (and another reason was that I could not use Matlab on Linux).

I used Python for my master thesis (for simplified modelling heat/flow simulations) and still use it regularly for data analysis.
