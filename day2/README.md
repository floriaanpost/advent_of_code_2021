# Javascript

The first javascript projectd I did was an auto browser close application if I remember correctely. The idea was that you had a tab open with a timer that you could set. After the timer ran out of time, the browser would shut down. The idea was that my younger brother would only have a limited amount of time that he was allowed to use the browser.

I remember doing debugging with alerts on this project, so it must have been before `console.log` was a thing, or I just did not know about it.

Looking at it now, I a not completely sure if the above project is even possible, because it seems strange that you would be allowed to shut down the entire browser. Anyway, it might have worked a little differently, but that is how I remember it.
