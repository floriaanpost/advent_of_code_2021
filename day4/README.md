# Matlab (/Octave)

During my mechanical engineering study I learned Matlab. I specialized in fluid mechanics. I used Matlab to (numerically) solve the diffential equations involved in fluid mechanics.

I no longer have Matlab installed on my laptop and absolutely not intent to pay for it, so I will solve this puzzle with Octave instead.

Doing this puzzle I experienced again how slow Matlab is (or Octave at least). I could probably optimize a lot (and remove a lot of loops) but as I have no real intent of using Matlab again, I don't want to spend time making the code even less readable but faster.
