# PHP

I learned PHP when I joined a surfing association during my study years. The website [www.dwvhardboard.nl](https://www.dwvhardboard.nl/) was (and still is) created with Drupal and I made some updates to it. I have never used PHP again since, except for some tweaks to a Wordpress website from a friend of mine.
