# C++

I learned c++ during my study. I think I wanted to learn it becuase is was faster than most of the scripting languages I knew. The first project I did was an optimizer for the delivery of the magazine from the surfing association I was a member of. The magazine was delivered by the board and there where 150 members. I made a tool (web app) that visually showed the shortest route to visit all those members (or a selection of the members in a certain district). I made the optimizer in C++.

I am using C++ again now in an embedded software project (although its more C).
