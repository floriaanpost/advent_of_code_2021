# Typescript

I learned Typescript because it makes it much easier to write good Javascript code, and reduces the amount of runtime errors by a lot. After I learned it, I never wanted to go back to regular Javascript (and never did), at least not for larger projects.

The code may not be the most elegant today, but I solved it really fast and had no desire to put more work into it.
